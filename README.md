- 👋 Hi, I’m @Janiczek
- 👀 I’m interested in Elm, property based testing, compilers, piano, bass guitar.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - compilers by reading through and [implementing](https://github.com/Janiczek/elm-lox-1) the language Lox from the book ["Crafting Interpreters"](http://craftinginterpreters.com)
  - game design by working on [NuAshworld](https://github.com/Janiczek/nu-ashworld)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [elm-in-elm/compiler](https://github.com/elm-in-elm/compiler)
